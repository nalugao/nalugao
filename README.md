# Hi there!
<p align="left">
Developer in training, committed to creating modern, functional, and purposeful solutions. <br>
I focus my studies on both <strong>Front-End</strong> and <strong>Back-End</strong> development, aiming to become a well-rounded FullStack developer throughout my Software Engineering journey.

- I have a channel on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@nalugao) that I created to practice public speaking by explaining the code I develop, while also supporting those starting out in programming
